# ToDo Checklist.

- [X] Document the Old Implementation
- [ ] Convert to a modern DB that is able to be deployed to a Web host
- [ ] Move the Generation to a Generic class able to be shunted into an Interactive form, Haxe should make this easy since it should be able to be hooked into the new Class and be able to create the interactive pieces without needing to do fullstack insanity.
- [ ] Create a solution to Deal with the SDE, as CCP enjoys Fucking with the Status quo and being able to rapidly deal with that is important
- [ ] Finally Plug in Eve OAuth to allow users to Modify their view and save it and Expose more info from the API
